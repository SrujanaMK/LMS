LMS

The Library Management System (LMS) is designed to streamline library operations with distinct student and admin accounts. Students can access the system to view and issue books, while admins have the ability to manage books, delete user accounts, and oversee the entire system. Account authentication is handled securely via email, ensuring only registered users can access their respective accounts. Admins have full control over book management, including adding, updating, and deleting books, as well as managing users and handling book issue functionality. This system aims to enhance user experience, simplify library processes, and provide efficient management tools for admins.

My Role

LMS project, I worked as a Frontend Developer, focusing on creating a user-friendly and responsive interface. I developed features such as the login page, book management screens, and the book issue functionality, ensuring a smooth and intuitive experience for both students and admins. My role also involved optimizing the design for both desktop and mobile views to enhance accessibility and usability.
